Create Calibration Class, finds the top left corner, then the one to the left then uses that data to find the rest
of the squares

Create class to scan over the board using the calibrate coords, scans the board at set intervals and checks to see if
it is different from the previous scan and if so then the turn is switched from the other player to the AI and vise
versa. To start, attempt to make a move, if the board does not change then it is the opponents turn this info can be
used to detect what colour the AI is.

Write AI using the minimax algo, you have to learn it now nerd, create class for this and then one to control the mouse.

Have a Gamestate class that scans though the board at set intervals and creates a char array of the game state based on
what rgb values are in each square (these can be hard coded in as they never change), if the board is different then
the turn is switched
